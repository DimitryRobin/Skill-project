Who am I ?
Education
I made a bac STI2D specialty Information System and Digital, to guide me in the
computer field.
I am currently under obtaining BTS SIO SLAM option (software solutions and business applications)
to specialize myself as an IT developer.
Thereafter, I intend to undertake a formation CDPN alternately in pure software development.
At this point, I find it important to mix the theoretical and practice while receiving remuneration.
I envisage, as part of my studies, to get a Master in order to obtain a BAC +5
and more improved skills as a developer.

About
Back
Skill project is an application created entirely by myself, in order to list all the skills
that I have gained so far. The idea for this little program came to me when I learned that we must to keep
all traces of practical embodiment, during my teaching BTS, to pass the test E6.
That is why I told myself: why not create a portfolio of skills in software form ?
After approbration of my teachers about the possibility to use this method for the examination, I
was put to the task. Then I realized, as and as I was developing that project Skill
could serve others.
I then asked the question: why not to change the application to help my neighbor ?
Continued on this reasoning, Skill project was born and evolves gradually in order to provide answers to
questions of all developers, but also to offer different content than that found on the internet.
Due to its ease of use and friendly interface, allows Skill project :
- learn by copying a simple click, the code of a skill
- to make suggestions (improve software, adding new skills etc ..)
- to share my skills and knowledge with you
Finally, Skill project requires no connection to a database, firstly because there is no 
web host to my knowledge, of application C # (except db4free.net, test environnnement) and in
second time because the connection to a database, via requests, could slow down the software.
To manage the preferences of each user, it is possible that .txt file be set up on your
computer in the only goal to save your settings.
